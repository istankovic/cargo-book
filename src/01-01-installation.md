## Installation

The easiest way to get Cargo is to get the current stable release of Rust by
using the `rustup` script:

```shell
$ curl -sSf https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup.sh | sh
```

This will get you the current stable release of Rust for your platform along
with the latest Cargo.

If you are on Windows, you can directly download the latest stable Rust and nightly Cargo:

- [Rust (32-bit)](https://static.rust-lang.org/dist/rust-1.17.0-i686-pc-windows-gnu.msi)
- [Cargo (32-bit)](https://static.rust-lang.org/cargo-dist/cargo-nightly-i686-pc-windows-gnu.tar.gz)

- [Rust (64-bit)](https://static.rust-lang.org/dist/rust-1.17.0-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu.msi)
- [Cargo (64-bit)](https://static.rust-lang.org/cargo-dist/cargo-nightly-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu.tar.gz)

Alternatively, you can [build Cargo from source](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo#compiling-from-source).
